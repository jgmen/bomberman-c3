# Bomberman C3

- This project is a C3 rewrite of Bomberman, originally developed in C with Raylib by the group of Kaio Jesus (https://github.com/KaioJesus/Bomberman).
- The goal of this rewrite is to leverage the simplicity and lightweight nature of C3, keeping the original gameplay.

## Features

- Player Movement: W, A, S, D or arrow keys
- Planting Bombs: press B
- Dynamic Explosions: destroy blocks and enemies
- Smart Enemies: random movement and collisions that reduce lives
- Key Collection: pick up keys to progress through levels
- Multiple Levels: progressively challenging maps
- Lives and Score System: UI displaying lives, points, and available bombs
- Menus and Status Screens: main menu, Game Over, and victory screen
- Save/Load Game: persist the game state
